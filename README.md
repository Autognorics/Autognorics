# AUTOGNORICS: 
## The Science of Engineered Life Forms

WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANEURAL AUTOGNORICS

Autognorics is the science of engineered life forms, things, machines, or systems. In short, it is the study of creating a living machine. It was conceptualized by Engr Joey Lawsin in 1988 who wanted to reshape the framework of artificial intelligence and machine learning by introducing a new paradigm known as Theory of M.I.N.D. or Autognorics' Aneural Wise Sytems. In this new paragon of creating synthetic life-forms, called Gnorics or ELFS, IOs and EIs are its fundamentals units. Gnorics are classified as homognorics, biognorics, and zoikrons.

SELFS or the System of Engineered Life-forms, technically named Autognorization, is a hierarchical system, process, or approach where intuitive objects, embedded inscriptions, and the inverse-reverse dimetrix are incorporated together in the creation of a living machine or system that embodies the six signatures of life, namely: the mechanization of aliveness, the sensation of awareness, the codification of consciousness, the intuitiveness of logic, the selfness of knowledge, and the experience of lifeness.

According to Lawsin, Life evolves from being alive to being living. It is a evolutinary process that is governed by six stages. These signatures are based on the states of being of the individual. These six Sequential Orders of Life are as follows:

1. Aliveness = is the ability to consume energy without the need for neural reasoning.
2. Awareness = is the ability to send and receive signals using intuitive sensors without the need for neural reasoning.
3. Consciousness = is the ability to match things with things without the need for neural reasoning.
4. Intutiveness = is the ability to choose this or that without the need for neural reasoning.
5. Selfness = is the ability to realize oneself or self-knowledge.
6. Lifeness = is the ability to experience life or to live.

In the succeeding articles, the following new ideas in the creation of a Living Machine are explored:
1. [The Sensoric Awareness of a Machine](https://autognorics.github.io/Sensoric_Awareness/)
2. [The Aneural Consciousness of a Machine](https://autognorics.github.io/Aneural_Consciousness/)
3. [The Algorithmic Intuitiveness of a Machine](https://autognorics.github.io/Algorithmic_Intuitiveness/)
4. [The Neural Selfness of a Machine](https://autognorics.github.io/Neural_Selfness/) 
5. [Intuitive Objects and Embedded Inscriptions](https://autognorics.github.io/Intuitive_Objects/)
6. [A Brain without the Brain Paradigm](https://autognorics.github.io/Aneural-Intuitive-Systems/)

The new concept Autognorics was uncovered from the study on Orignemology.

Originemology is the science behind the beginning of everything, the "study of the origin of origins". It is a pioneering discipline that examines generally the roots or origins of everything and everyone based on the natural emergence of instructions comprehensively known as Creation by Law. It deals with the etymology, originator, history, semantics, onomatology, eponym, and origin of a thing, a word, a label, tag, or idea.

This new school of thought was conceptualized mainly to determine the Genesis of Information - the origin, creation, and evolution of early primordial, ancient, and modern information based on the following basic scientific questions:

1. How did information emerge into the early minds of the very first humans?
2. Who supplied our primitive ancestors with information?
3. Where did it originate? Where did it come from?
4. Was the source of information a who or a what? Was it god, space aliens, or something else?
5. What is creation by laws?

Its integral component is twofold: first, it examines the origins of ideas, labels, or concepts made-up by man like languages, numbers, behaviors, emotions, gods, tools; and second, it investigates the origins of objects created by nature like the universe, elements, plants and animals.

In a broader sense, Originemology is a cross-interdisciplinary body of thoughts based on prevailing comparative researches found in many subfields of study such areas as anthropology, archaeology, geography, history, chronology, etymology, ideology, onomatology, ontology, and epistemology. The main goal of the collaboration is to systematically trace backward the primal source or origin of information or idea - either abstract or physical, from being a single elemental entity to an emerging complex structure - with evidence-based findings and guided by these 5 primary questions:

1. How did the original idea emerge?
2. Who provided the original idea?
3. Where was the idea first conceptualized
4. When was the idea first conceptualized?
5. Why was the idea conceptualized in the first place?

The five cardinal collaborating principles that lay the foundations of Originemology constitute the following signature theories:
1. The Caveman in the Box Trilogy,
2. Codexation,
3. Scriptional Jump,
4. Dimetrix,
5. Inscriptions by Design

The new study is also instrumental in shedding new insights into the five major ancient questions:
1. Who or what created the universe?
2. How all creation is created?
3. Where did we come from?
4. Why are we here?

Fragments of the text here were extracted from the book Originemology. Some ideas emerged in an early version of the manuscript on Creation by Laws. The general view discussed in this hub was covered during the various exploratory experiments conducted in the Biotronics Project (Lawsin,1988).
