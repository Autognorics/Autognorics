# AUTOGNORICS: 
## The Science of Engineered Life Forms

WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANEURAL AUTOGNORICS

The Theory of M.I.N.D. :
1.Mechanical Emergence of Aliveness.


2. Sensoric Awareness.


3. Aneural Consciousness.


4. Algorithmic Intuitiveness.


5. Neural Selfness.


6. The Four Marks of a Living Machine:

It can transcodify abstracts to physicals (the primary indicator of consciousness);
It can transform physicals into mechanical actions or movements (inscription by design);
It can transfer motions into repetitive or autonomous actions (intuitive objects);
It can translate embedded experiences into self persona (feeling, thinking, behaving).
The fourth mark might seem impossible. Yet, based on the standards of SELFS, the probability is already in a matter of time. The anymal in the video is actually partially a living machine. The robot is already wired up with four out of the six elements of life: aliveness, awareness, consciousness, and intuitiveness. It is also living, the fifth element, because it can be automatically programmed to self-reproduce, self-consume energy, etc. And lastly, Its persona of being with life (lifeness), the sixth element, is already attainable through the Materialization of Information & Inscription by Design, also known as the "Theory of M.I.N.D."

What is the Theory of the M.I.N.D. ?
