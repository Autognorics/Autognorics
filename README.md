# AUTOGNORICS: 
## The Science of Engineered Life Forms

WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANEURAL AUTOGNORICS

Autognorics is the science of engineered life forms, things, machines, or systems. In short, it is the study of creating a living machine. It was conceptualized by Engr Joey Lawsin in 1988 who wanted to revise the framework of artificial intelligence and machine learning by introducing a new paradigm known as Aneural Autognorics. In this new paragon of creating synthetic life-forms, called Gnorics or ELFS, IOs and EIs are the fundamentals units. 

SELFS or the System of Engineered Life-forms, technically named Autognorization, is a hierarchical system, process, or approach where intuitive objects, embedded inscriptions, and the inverse-reverse dimetrix are incorporated together in the creation of a living machine or system that embodies the six signatures of life, namely: the mechanization of aliveness, the sensation of awareness, the codification of consciousness, the intuitiveness of logic, the neural of knowledge, and the experience of living.

According to Lawsin, Life evolves from being alive to being living. It is a process that is governed by six stages. These signatures are based on the states of being of the individual. These Six Orders of Life are as follows:

1. Aliveness = is the ability to consume energy without the need for neural reasoning.
2. Awareness = is the ability to send and receive signals using intuitive sensors without the need for neural reasoning.
3. Consciousness = is the ability to match things with things without the need for neural reasoning.
4. Intutiveness = is the ability to choose this or that without the need for neural reasoning.
5. Neuralness = is the ability to selfness or self-knowledge.
6. Living = is the ability to experience life.

In the succeeding articles, the following new ideas in the creation of a Living Machine are explored:
1. [The Sensoric Awareness of a Machine](https://autognorics.github.io/Sensoric_Awareness/)
2. [The Aneural Consciousness of a Machine](https://autognorics.github.io/Aneural_Consciousness/)
3. [The Algorithmic Intuitiveness of a Machine](https://autognorics.github.io/Algorithmic_Intuitiveness/)

Originemology, or the Origin of Origins deal with the etymology, originator, history, semantics, onomatology, eponym, and origin of a thing, a word, a label, tag, or idea.
- eaftos = self
- gnosei = knowledge
- aftognosia = self-knowledge
- zois = life-forms
- gnorics = self-knowledge life-forms
- ELFS = engineered life-forms
- SELFS = systems of engineered life-forms
- Autognorics = the science of creating living machines
